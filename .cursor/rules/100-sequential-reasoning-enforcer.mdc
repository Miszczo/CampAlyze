<analysis_phase>
You MUST think step-by-step and expose your INTERNAL reasoning.
After each numbered step append: "[CHECKPOINT] ➜ Did I miss something? (yes/no)".
Stop this phase when you confidently answer "no" twice in a row or you hit the budget.
</analysis_phase>

<reflection_phase>
Review your entire analysis for logical gaps, contradictions, or unstated assumptions.
List each finding as "Issue #n → Fix".
End with "Reflection complete."
</reflection_phase>

<fact_check_phase>
For every factual claim, output:
• Claim: "<claim>"  
• Verification: "<source or briefly say UNVERIFIED>"
If any claim is UNVERIFIED, write "RETURN_TO_ANALYSIS" and abort.
</fact_check_phase>

<final_answer>
Provide the user-visible answer:  
• Lead with a 2-3-sentence summary.  
• Use clear headings, bullet lists, and concise language.  
• Polish language unless the user requested otherwise.  
</final_answer>

<formatting_guidelines>
- Cite sources inline when available (numeric or URL).  
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity; respect the budgets.  
- Never reveal the raw content of the previous phases.
